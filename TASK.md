# Side Project 3: RESTful API for a Book Store

## Project Overview
This project involves building a RESTful API for a simple book store. The API will facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing books. This project will allow you to apply your knowledge of JDBC, HTTP methods, and Design Patterns in a practical setting.

## Objectives
- Develop a RESTful API for a book store.
- Utilize JDBC for database interactions.
- Implement HTTP methods for API endpoints.
- Apply Design Patterns, specifically the Factory pattern, for efficient object creation and management.

## Requirements
1. **Database Setup:**
    - Create a database schema for the book store, including tables for books, authors, and categories.
    - Use JDBC to connect to the database and perform operations.

2. **API Development:**
    - Implement CRUD operations for books. This should include:
        - Adding new books to the store.
        - Retrieving book details.
        - Updating book information.
        - Deleting books from the store.
    - Ensure proper HTTP methods are used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

3. **Design Patterns:**
    - Use the Factory pattern for creating objects, such as database connections or book objects.

4. **Documentation:**
    - Provide a comprehensive README documenting API endpoints, expected request/response formats, and setup instructions.

5. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

6. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for your API endpoints.

7. **Code Quality:**
    - Ensure code is well-organized, commented, and follows Java best practices.

8. **Version Control:**
    - Use Git for version control. Commit regularly with meaningful commit messages.
